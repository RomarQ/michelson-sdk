# Contributing to the project
I would love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug;
- Discussing the current state of the code;
- Submitting a fix;
- Proposing new features;
- Becoming a maintainer;

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase ([Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). Your pull requests are welcome:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`;
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests;
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation;
4. Ensure tests are passing;
5. Make sure your code lints;
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the `MIT` License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/RomarQ/michelson-sdk/issues)
GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/RomarQ/michelson-sdk/issues/new).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs;
* 80 character line length;

## License
